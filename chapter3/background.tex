\section{what is an Environment?}
\label{sec:SEAbackground}



In this work, we chose to focus on operating system,
file system, and network
environmental issues.
These issues are
readily visible in data returned
by the system calls
an application makes.
We took advantage of this in our implementation of SEA as CrashSimulator by
intercepting and manipulating system call results.
As we will discuss, this allowed us to strike a good balance between a
higher level approach, such as hooking library functions, and a lower level
approach like directly altering memory values.
In our evaluation we take a deeper look at anomalies from
these three categories in order to assess the technique's effectiveness.
We do not consider processor-based environmental differences as bugs related to those are being handled by other
work~\cite{Alglave:2018:FSC:3173162.3177156}.
