\textbf{Preston Kent Moore} was born in Bristol, Tennessee on November 18, 1988.  He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from East Tennessee State University in 2011, and completed a Master of Science degree in Computer Science two years later. Between these degrees he held a System Analyst position at Eastman Chemical company. Following his M.S. graduation he held a Lecturer Position in East Tennessee State University's Computer Science Department and a Software Project Manager position with the Emerging Technology Center.
In the fall of 2015 he began work on his Ph.D. at NYU Tandon School of Engineering's Computer Science and Engineering Department.  During this program he worked as a research assistant \textit{(Preston: I might need to look up scholarships/fellowships?)} in the Secure Systems Lab.  He twice held adjunct teaching positions in the CSE department.

Preston's research in the course of this program focused on application security and reliability.
This work explored a novel technique for testing applications by exposing them to simulations of problematic situations that caused other applications to fail.
To investigate this topic, he constructed two new pieces of software: CrashSimulator and PORT (Pattern Observation, Recognition, and Transformation).  CrashSimulator acts as a framework for simulating these situations while PORT is a domain specific language tailored to ease the process of capturing them.

He published one conference article with the International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE) and one poster with the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group for Computer Science Education.  The former was presented at ISSRE 2019 and received the best paper and presentation award.  The latter was presented at ACM SIGCSE 2022.  He additionally he presented is work at RSA 2019 as part of that conference's security scholar program.  \textit{There are some funding things and grant things and other such stuff that preston should be sure to mention in closing.}
