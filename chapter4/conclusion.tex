A great deal of value can be gained from the analysis of an application's
activity.
% We set out to find a better way to pull this value out of the large
% volume of activity an activity produces
% Restate this sentence as the positive
Unfortunately,
the volume of activity
an application produces
makes it difficult
to separate out
unimportant sequences.
In this work,
we demonstrate our effort
to improve the situation
through the use of
our new domain specific language
- PORT.
The language offers
a way to write concise,
but powerful,
descriptions of
significant application activity sequences.
These descriptions
can be compiled
into programs capable of
both recognizing the described activity
sequence
and modifying its contents in order to
facilitate more active testing.

We have also
illustrated PORT's fitness
by showing
how easily it
can be extended
to support other activity
representations
and how it can be employed
in realizing proven-useful
strategies from other work.
The former was done
by documenting the process
of adding XMLRPC and JSONRPC support
while the latter came about
through an explanation
of how PORT could be used to
detect malicious application behavior.
% We need another sentence here explaining the above

% Some sort of call to action, mention that code is available somewhere,
% invitation to try it out

% Maybe emphasize the malicious application behavior detection a bit more
