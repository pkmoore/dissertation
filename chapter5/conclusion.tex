A great deal of value can be gained from the analysis of an application's
activity.
% We set out to find a better way to pull this value out of the large
% volume of activity an activity produces
% Restate this sentence as the positive
Unfortunately,
the volume of activity
an application produces
makes it difficult
to separate out
unimportant sequences.
In this work,
we demonstrate how our new domain specific language,
PORT offers
a way to write concise and 
powerful
descriptions of
application activity sequences.
These descriptions
can be compiled
into programs that
both recognize the described activity
sequence
and modify its contents in order to
facilitate more active testing.

We have also
illustrated that PORT
can be
easily extended
to support other activity
representations, and to 
realize proven-useful
strategies from other work.
The former was done
by documenting the process
of adding XMLRPC and JSONRPC support,
while the latter is found in
 an explanation
of how PORT could be used to
detect malicious application behavior.
% We need another sentence here explaining the above

% Some sort of call to action, mention that code is available somewhere,
% invitation to try it out

% Maybe emphasize the malicious application behavior detection a bit more
