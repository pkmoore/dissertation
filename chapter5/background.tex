\subsection{Our Motivating Example}
\label{sec:MotivatingExample}
% How SEA showed success using system calls

The initial impetus for this work was sparked by the Simulating Environmental Anomalies (SEA) technique developed by Moore et al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/issre/MooreCFW19}.
This effort centered on the key insight
that problematic
environmental properties,
known as anomalies, are visible in the
communications between the components that make up an application.
The researchers found that,
once captured,
these anomalies
could be
used to simulate and 
test
an application as if
it had been encountered
in the real world.
Results of system calls made
during execution were recorded, modified, and replayed to simulate whether or not the application
responded correctly to the anomaly.
Using this strategy, the authors were able to identify a number of bugs
in major applications.

As a concrete example of the above
consider the ``Unusual File types'' anomaly
discussed in the SEA paper's evaluation.
This anomaly may be problematic
when an application running under Linux
attempts to open and read data from a file on disk.
Linux supports several special file types  that require special procedures to 
write to and
read from.
The SEA technique
may simulate the presence of such a file by
modifying
the return value
of a {\tt stat} call.
PORT improves on the original procedure for employing such an anomaly
by simplifying how a target pattern
and its desired modifications are employed.

Our takeaway
from this study
was that an application's activity
can be systematically mined to find bugs.
In this paper, we
show that the best way to extract this data
is to treat application activity
as a sequence of events. This enables us to use
proven event processing techniques. 
Yet, it became apparent that existing
stream processing tools
are not well suited to this task. To apply
SEA's success to other activity types,
such as calls to library functions
and remote procedure calls, we needed to develop a novel tool that would be  agnostic to the way an application's activity has been recorded. As such, it required its own  distinct language. 


%%% What are we really doing here.  WHY did we decided to make this language?
%%% That's really the question that needs to be answered.  I think that instead
%%% of making things up that we had the language and decided to apply it here
%%% we need to talk about how seeing the success of this work motivated us to
%%% try it at a larger scale.  We can avoid talk of "Augmenting" SEA or
%%% whatever though

%\subsection{Explaining Environmental Bugs}
%
%Before we discuss the details of our bug-finding efforts it is necessary to
%draw a boundary around the types of bugs we are targeting.
%This work sets its sights on the bugs that occur when some external
%entity supplies unexpected or incorrect data to an
%application resulting in its failure.
%Such bugs may appear in simple situations like a library function that
%returns data in an unexpected format or in scenarios as complex
%as a request to a remote
%system returning bad data because of corruption on an intermediate network
%node.
%Both cases share the commonality that the symptoms of misbehavior
%can be found in a recording of the application's activity.
%These bugs, defined by Moore et al. as ``environmental bugs,''
%often cause applications to fail after deployment
%and occur with such frequency
%that the ``works on my machine'' phenomenon is a well known
%source of pain
%and frequent topic of discussion
%in software and project management
%literature~\cite{worksonmymachine}.
%Post-deployment bugs are a widespread problem
%and they come with significant costs
%both in financial terms and,
%in the worst cases,
%loss of life~\cite{WONG201768}.
%
%The impact of these bugs continues to be reinforced by the regular
%appearance of dangerous environmental bugs in major pieces of
%software~\cite{devzeroroot}.  And it appears that no class of application
%is safe with environmental bugs affecting operating
%systems~\cite{ubuntuappaport},
%user applications~\cite{westerndigitalsymlink} and crucial security
%programs~\cite{sudocopy} in the
%last year alone!

\subsection{Why a New Domain Specific Language?}


%The decision to create a new domain specific language was not one we
%undertook lightly. 
%as such an effort takes
%a significant amount of work
%to define,
%implement, document, and support.
In designing  and implementing a new domain specific language, we needed to meet some specific criteria. For starters, the language had to be able to identify specific
patterns as they appear in a recording of application activity.
A simple model,
such as a deterministic finite automaton (i.e. a DFA or a FSA) enhanced to operate on complex
structures, would appear to be sufficient.
Unfortunately, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:StraceListing}, the simple model will not work.  The {\tt open()} call produces a file descriptor that a subsequent {\tt
read()} call may match.
Yet, a standard DFA or FSA cannot match patterns with this sort of dependency. 
Instead, we need a language
that can easily capture
the internal contents of events,
like argument data,
pointer addresses,
and return values. This content can then be
manipulated for
reuse in subsequent operations.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily\small,gobble=4,xleftmargin=.8em]
    event open {filedesc: Number@ret};
    event read {filedesc: Number@0};
    event close {filedesc: Number@0,
                 retval: Number@ret};
    open({filedesc: fd});
    not read({filedesc: ?fd});
    close({filedesc: ?fd});
  \end{lstlisting}
  \begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily\scriptsize]
pattern = Pattern(
  SeqOperator(
     PrimitiveEventStructure("OPEN", "a"),
     NegationOperator(
        PrimitiveEventStructure("READ","b")
     ),
     PrimitiveEventStructure("CLOSE","c")),
AndCondition(EqCondition(
     Variable("a", lambda x: x["File Handle"]),
     Variable("c", lambda x: x["File Handle"])),
     EqCondition(
     Variable("c", lambda x: x["File Handle"]),
     Variable("b", lambda x: x["File Handle"]))),
timedelta(minutes=10))
  \end{lstlisting}
  \caption{

  where a program opens a file and closes it without reading from it.

}
  \label{fig:CompareListing}
\end{figure}



One possibility is to deploy more expressive automata models, such as register automata~\cite{DBLP:journals/tcs/KaminskiF94} or session automata~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/BolligHLM14}.  As the 
SEA researchers found,  the ability to
{\textit modify} activity can create scenarios to ensure
application failures rather than  waiting for them to occur.
Several feature-rich event processing
languages and libraries do have these capabilities, but
modifying and outputting
incoming events
is by no means a straightforward experience.
In many cases, producing such an output stream  would require
falling back on the fully-featured nature of a host language (e.g. Java) -- a situation
we hoped to avoid.

In the initial stages of PORT's development, we also
evaluated several
complex event processing (CEP) languages that
could
provide some of the pattern and predicate matching primitives
that we wished to
incorporate.
Sadly,
these languages did not
support  the features
we require,
or were too complex
for the easy to use  system we wanted to offer.
Typically,
programs for these complex event processing engines are
written in the engine's build or host language,
such as Java,
Scala or
Python.
Such languages generally bring with them a great deal of boilerplate code,
that can obscure or confuse
the program's meaning.
Recent studies
have affirmed that excessive and complicated code
patterns can harm
understanding and
maintainability~\cite{misunderstandings}.
Further,
it means that the author,
and future maintainers,
of a
program must be fluent in this host language.
%Finally,
%these languages include features and optimizations
%that would likely not be useful for our application domain, such as time-based event windows,
%merging multiple event streams,
%and the calculation of
%summary statistics over specified fields. 


To demonstrate these points concretely,
we consider two programs that can recognize a system call sequence wherein an
application opens and closes a file
without reading from it.
The top of Figure~\ref{fig:CompareListing} shows a PORT program that implements this
task.  The first three statements in this program define the events (i.e.
system calls) and parameters relevant to the task it performs.  The final three statements express that the event stream
should contain an \texttt{open()} call followed by a \texttt{close()} call on the same file descriptor, with no intermittent \texttt{read()} call.

We compare this program\footnote{The program can be executed using the code and tools available at: \textit{Link Removed for Blinding Purposes}.}
with a corresponding program written in OpenCEP~\cite{open_cep_website} located at the bottom of Figure~\ref{fig:CompareListing},
a CEP module for the Python programming language.
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CompareListing},
the PORT program is both more concise, with its main work accomplished in just
three lines of code, and more readable because it is not constrained by the
requirements of a host programming language.
Unlike  OpenCEP and similar languages, PORT can modify and output an event.
That is, the program in Figure~\ref{fig:CompareListing} could be
re-purposed to not only find the appropriate pattern but also modify the
results of the {\tt close} call to simulate a failure.
This would be achieved
by adding the following output clause to line 8 of the program 
as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none,xleftmargin=0em,gobble=2]
  close({filedesc: ?fd}) -> close({retval: -1});
\end{lstlisting}
If the modified PORT program is executed on the system call trace shown in the upper half of Fig.~\ref{fig:StraceListing}, it will produce the modified trace shown in the bottom half.


% A domain specific language like PORT provides a more
% concise syntax that makes it easier for all individuals to read and
% write relevant programs in.
% In light of this, we believe the benefits of a
% new programming language
% focused on letting its users get a lot of work done
% with a small amount of easily-readable code should be self-evident.

% The second front involves PORT's programming paradigm.
% While other event processing languages tend toward functional or
% declarative programming,
% PORT programs more closely follow an imperative programming style.
% We came to this decision because studies
% have shown that developers are more likely to be familiar and comfortable
% with such a paradigm~\cite{XXXX}.  We believe this will make it easier for
% developers to learn the language, foster greater popularity, and it aligns
% with the goals presented in our motivating example.
