  abstract = {Numerous systems have been designed which use virtualization to subdivide
	the ample resources of a modern computer. Some require specialized
	hardware, or cannot support commodity operating systems. Some target
	100% binary compatibility at the expense of performance. Others sacrifiece
	security or functionality for speed. Few offer resource isolation
	or performance guarantees; most provide only best-effort provisioning,
	risking denial of service. This paper presents Xen, an x86 virtual
	machine monitor which allows multiple commodity operating systems
	to share conventional hardware in a safe and resource managed fashion,
	but without sacrifiecing either performance or functionality. This
	is achieved by providing an idealized virtual machine abstraction
	to which operating systems such as Linux, BSD and Windows XP, can
	be ported with minimal effort. Our design is targeted at hosting
	up to 100 virtual machine instancessimultaneously on a modern server.
	The virtualization approach taken by Xen is extremely efficient:
	we allow operating systems such as Linux and Windows XP to be hosted
	simultaneously for a negligible performance overhead . at most a
	few percent compared with the unvirtualized case. We considerably
	outperform competing commercial and freely available solutions in
	a range of microbenchmarks and system-wide tests.},

It is useful in many scenarios: server consolidation, virtual test environments, and for Linux enthusiasts who still can not decide which distribution is best. Recently, hardware vendors of commodity x86 processors have added virtualization extensions to the instruction set that can be utilized to write relatively simple virtual machine monitors.The Kernel-based Virtual Machine, or kvm, is a new Linux subsystem which leverages these virtualization extensions to add a virtual machine monitor (or hyper- visor) capability to Linux. Using kvm, one can create and run multiple virtual machines. These virtual ma- chines appear as normal Linux processes and integrate seamlessly with the rest of the system.}},

    abstract = {{Hypervisors, popularized by Xen and VMware, are quickly becoming commodity. They are appropriate for many usage scenarios, but there are scenarios that require system virtualization with high degrees of both isolation and efficiency. Examples include HPC clusters, the Grid, hosting centers, and PlanetLab. We present an alternative to hypervisors that is better suited to such scenarios. The approach is a synthesis of prior work on resource containers and security containers applied to general-purpose, time-shared operating systems. Examples of such container-based systems include Solaris 10, Virtuozzo for Linux, and Linux-VServer. As a representative instance of container-based systems, this paper describes the design and implementation of Linux-VServer. In addition, it contrasts the architecture of Linux-VServer with current generations of Xen, and shows how Linux-VServer provides comparable support for isolation and superior system efficiency.}},

    abstract = {{Numerous systems have been designed which use virtualization to subdivide the ample resources of a modern computer. Some require specialized hardware, or cannot support commodity operating systems. Some target 100\% binary compatibility at the expense of performance. Others sacrifice security or functionality for speed. Few offer resource isolation or performance guarantees; most provide only best-effort provisioning, risking denial of service.This paper presents Xen, an x86 virtual machine monitor which allows multiple commodity operating systems to share conventional hardware in a safe and resource managed fashion, but without sacrificing either performance or functionality. This is achieved by providing an idealized virtual machine abstraction to which operating systems such as Linux, BSD and Windows XP, can be ported with minimal effort.Our design is targeted at hosting up to 100 virtual machine instances simultaneously on a modern server. The virtualization approach taken by Xen is extremely efficient: we allow operating systems such as Linux and Windows XP to be hosted simultaneously for a negligible performance overhead --- at most a few percent compared with the unvirtualized case. We considerably outperform competing commercial and freely available solutions in a range of microbenchmarks and system-wide tests.}},

    abstract = {
                {SUMMARY}: Modern biological experiments create vast amounts of data which are geographically distributed. These datasets consist of petabytes of raw data and billions of documents. Yet to the best of our knowledge, a search engine technology that searches and cross-links all different data types in life sciences does not exist. We have developed a prototype distributed scientific search engine technology, 'Sciencenet', which facilitates rapid searching over this large data space. By 'bringing the search engine to the data', we do not require server farms. This platform also allows users to contribute to the search index and publish their large-scale data to support {e-Science}. Furthermore, a community-driven method guarantees that only scientific content is crawled and presented. Our peer-to-peer approach is sufficiently scalable for the science web without performance or capacity tradeoff. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: The free to use search portal web page and the downloadable client are accessible at: http://sciencenet.kit.edu. The web portal for index administration is implemented in {ASP}.{NET}, the '{AskMe}' experiment publisher is written in Python 2.7, and the backend '{YaCy}' search engine is based on Java 1.6.

@inproceedings{Bassett_2010,
    abstract = {{Traceroute is the most widely used Internet diagnostic tool today. Network operators use it to help identify routing failures, poor performance, and router misconfigurations. Researchers use it to map the Internet, predict performance, geolocate routers, and classify the performance of ISPs. However, traceroute has a fundamental limitation that affects all these applications: it does not provide reverse path information. Although various public traceroute servers across the Internet provide some visibility, no general method exists for determining a reverse path from an arbitrary destination. In this paper, we address this longstanding limitation by building a reverse traceroute system. Our system provides the same information as traceroute, but for the reverse path, and it works in the same case as traceroute, when the user may lack control of the destination. We use a variety of measurement techniques to incrementally piece together the path from the destination back to the source. We deploy our system on PlanetLab and compare reverse traceroute paths with traceroutes issued from the destinations. In the median case our tool finds 87\% of the hops seen in a directly measured traceroute along the same path, versus only 38\% if one simply assumes the path is symmetric, a common fallback given the lack of available tools. We then illustrate how we can use our reverse traceroute system to study previously unmeasurable aspects of the Internet: we present a case study of how a content provider could use our tool to troubleshoot poor path performance, we uncover more than a thousand peer-to-peer AS links invisible to current topology mapping efforts, and we measure the latency of individual backbone links with average error under a millisecond.}},

The Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) MAC protocol specifies shared medium (half duplex) operation, as well as full duplex operation. Speed specific Media Independent Interfaces (MIIs) allow use of selected Physical Layer devices (PHY) for operation over coaxial, twisted pair or fiber optic cables. System considerations for multisegment shared access networks describe the use of Repeaters which are defined for operational speeds up to 1000 Mb/s. Local Area Network (LAN) operation is supported at all speeds. Other specified capabilities include: various PHY types for access networks, PHYs suitable for metropolitan area network applications, and the provision of power over selected twisted pair PHY types.}},

It is useful in many scenarios: server consolidation, virtual test environments, and for Linux enthusiasts who still can not decide which distribution is best. Recently, hardware vendors of commodity x86 processors have added virtualization extensions to the instruction set that can be utilized to write relatively simple virtual machine monitors.The Kernel-based Virtual Machine, or kvm, is a new Linux subsystem which leverages these virtualization extensions to add a virtual machine monitor (or hyper- visor) capability to Linux. Using kvm, one can create and run multiple virtual machines. These virtual ma- chines appear as normal Linux processes and integrate seamlessly with the rest of the system.}},

    abstract = {{Hypervisors, popularized by Xen and VMware, are quickly becoming commodity. They are appropriate for many usage scenarios, but there are scenarios that require system virtualization with high degrees of both isolation and efficiency. Examples include HPC clusters, the Grid, hosting centers, and PlanetLab. We present an alternative to hypervisors that is better suited to such scenarios. The approach is a synthesis of prior work on resource containers and security containers applied to general-purpose, time-shared operating systems. Examples of such container-based systems include Solaris 10, Virtuozzo for Linux, and Linux-VServer. As a representative instance of container-based systems, this paper describes the design and implementation of Linux-VServer. In addition, it contrasts the architecture of Linux-VServer with current generations of Xen, and shows how Linux-VServer provides comparable support for isolation and superior system efficiency.}},

    abstract = {{Numerous systems have been designed which use virtualization to subdivide the ample resources of a modern computer. Some require specialized hardware, or cannot support commodity operating systems. Some target 100\% binary compatibility at the expense of performance. Others sacrifice security or functionality for speed. Few offer resource isolation or performance guarantees; most provide only best-effort provisioning, risking denial of service.This paper presents Xen, an x86 virtual machine monitor which allows multiple commodity operating systems to share conventional hardware in a safe and resource managed fashion, but without sacrificing either performance or functionality. This is achieved by providing an idealized virtual machine abstraction to which operating systems such as Linux, BSD and Windows XP, can be ported with minimal effort.Our design is targeted at hosting up to 100 virtual machine instances simultaneously on a modern server. The virtualization approach taken by Xen is extremely efficient: we allow operating systems such as Linux and Windows XP to be hosted simultaneously for a negligible performance overhead --- at most a few percent compared with the unvirtualized case. We considerably outperform competing commercial and freely available solutions in a range of microbenchmarks and system-wide tests.}},

                {SUMMARY}: Modern biological experiments create vast amounts of data which are geographically distributed. These datasets consist of petabytes of raw data and billions of documents. Yet to the best of our knowledge, a search engine technology that searches and cross-links all different data types in life sciences does not exist. We have developed a prototype distributed scientific search engine technology, 'Sciencenet', which facilitates rapid searching over this large data space. By 'bringing the search engine to the data', we do not require server farms. This platform also allows users to contribute to the search index and publish their large-scale data to support {e-Science}. Furthermore, a community-driven method guarantees that only scientific content is crawled and presented. Our peer-to-peer approach is sufficiently scalable for the science web without performance or capacity tradeoff. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: The free to use search portal web page and the downloadable client are accessible at: http://sciencenet.kit.edu. The web portal for index administration is implemented in {ASP}.{NET}, the '{AskMe}' experiment publisher is written in Python 2.7, and the backend '{YaCy}' search engine is based on Java 1.6.

@inproceedings{Bassett_2010,
    abstract = {{Traceroute is the most widely used Internet diagnostic tool today. Network operators use it to help identify routing failures, poor performance, and router misconfigurations. Researchers use it to map the Internet, predict performance, geolocate routers, and classify the performance of ISPs. However, traceroute has a fundamental limitation that affects all these applications: it does not provide reverse path information. Although various public traceroute servers across the Internet provide some visibility, no general method exists for determining a reverse path from an arbitrary destination. In this paper, we address this longstanding limitation by building a reverse traceroute system. Our system provides the same information as traceroute, but for the reverse path, and it works in the same case as traceroute, when the user may lack control of the destination. We use a variety of measurement techniques to incrementally piece together the path from the destination back to the source. We deploy our system on PlanetLab and compare reverse traceroute paths with traceroutes issued from the destinations. In the median case our tool finds 87\% of the hops seen in a directly measured traceroute along the same path, versus only 38\% if one simply assumes the path is symmetric, a common fallback given the lack of available tools. We then illustrate how we can use our reverse traceroute system to study previously unmeasurable aspects of the Internet: we present a case study of how a content provider could use our tool to troubleshoot poor path performance, we uncover more than a thousand peer-to-peer AS links invisible to current topology mapping efforts, and we measure the latency of individual backbone links with average error under a millisecond.}},
