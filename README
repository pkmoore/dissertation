Some comments:

This is a template for PhD thesis, Poly style.  The main ingredient is
the class file polythesis.cls.  

thesis.tex is the main document, it contains nothing but some set up,
	   plus calls to include all the pieces, and nothing much
	   else.

	   run "pdflatex thesis" to generate the actual PDF file,
	   several times, until all the cross-references are resolved.

NOTE: There's an extra page at the beginning, just for you.  It's not
part of the thesis and can be removed.  In fact it MUST be removed
before the thesis is bound.

chapter1/
chapter2/
chapter3/ directory where chapter1-related files and figures are.
	  make one directory for every chapter, or remove directories
	  from the thesis.tex \include command and put all files in
	  the main directory.

Some packages that are used (or can be used) with Poly thesis class.
Comment them out in thesis.tex file, if you do not need them.

To create algorithms and make them float, like figures and tables:
- algorithm.sty   
- algorithmic.sty (outdated, needs replacement!)

Control over captions in figures etc:
- ccaption.sty

Layout of the page (HARDWIRED into the .cls file; cannot be removed):
- geometry.cfg

To be able to create figures with many subfigures (interacts with ccaption):
- subfigure.sty

To be able to nest sections very deeply (do NOT use unless you
absolutely have to; not pretty):
- subsections.sty
